# NoteHolder

configures a sustain pedal to hold the current note or next note played (as they do normally) but THEN it does not sustain any further notes until the held note is released.  It only sustains one note at a time.

This is useful for holding a bass note and layering on top of it.  Particularly useful for combining root notes from a MIDI guitar to play a bass patch while soloing or chording.

It is implemented with Javascript wrapped within a max4live plugin.
